### Hi there 👋 I'm Ruby Lo.
- 💡 I'm currently working in a medical device manufacturing company as a material analysis engineer based in Taiwan.  
- 😎 I'm learing web development skills, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, at ALPHA Camp (since January 2022).  
- 😁 I aim to be a backend engieer to switch my career to web development or digital industries.
- 😉 Python is my first language of coding. I also like it because I think it's elegant and very similar to human language.  
- 📫 You can reach me by rubylo718@gmail.com.
